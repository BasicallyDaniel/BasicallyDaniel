### Hi, I'm Daniel Karlberg ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring master's student at Chalmers University of Technology with a deep passion and interest in software development and all things technology. I enjoy working with software to solve complicated problems, but I also find enjoyment in using software to provide solutions to daily problems.

I am currently finishing my master's degree in Computer Systems & Networks, with specialization in distributed systems and security. Presently, I am working on my master's thesis in cooperation with Combitech AB, where I am developing, implementing and evaluating distributed fault-tolerant algorithms.
